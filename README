All code in the downloadable bundle is for the purpose of illustration and instruction only. The code
examples included are just small samples, often focusing on a single function or feature of a NoSQL 
product. Most code is tested within a development environment but is offered as-is, under no implicit 
or explicit warranty.A lot of NoSQL products are still evolving rapidly and so its possible some of 
the API(s) and function calls become deprecated by the time you run this code. Please verify the 
version of the software you are running against the one mentioned in the book, 
Professional NoSQL (Wiley, 2011), before we start debugging the code, if and when you may have 
problems running it successfully.

The downloadable code for each chapter of the book, Professional NoSQL (Wiley, 2011), is available
in a separate zip archive file. Each zip archive file is named as Ch<Chapter#>.zip, where Chapter# is
the chapter number. The code download includes commands to be typed in the interactive shell, programs
that can run as standalone applications, and programs that could be included in larger programs.

Commands to be run via the interactive shell are, in most cases, bundled together in a text file.
The names of such text files end with a .txt extension. The downloadable code includes runnable
Java, Python, Ruby, and PHP programs.
